# Markdown Mail

A UWP mail client that let you customize your own notification style.

You'll no longer need to find all the useful information through a pile of emails. You can view them in a uniform style on one page.

eg:

- You can uniform your Git Pull Request notifications and view them on one page.
- You can uniform your build process notifications and view them on one page.

You don't need to open them one by one above all!
